## HTML & CSS

The layout is pretty simple. You don't need any css library, right? ðŸ˜‰ 

**Spec**

1. A navigation menu displaying three links: Dogs, Adoptions and Checkout. (Dogs has the "current" state).

![navigation](mocks/nav.png)

2. Homepage (Dogs):

    1. It should display images and information about the dogs in a 3-column layout.
    2. The images must appear with the same proportions on the UI (even though they originally have variant resolutions!).
    3. Below the image/info, an `Adopt` button.

3. Adoptions should display a list of adopted dogs in a similar manner as the homepage (without any `Adopt` buttons though!).

4. Checkout:

    As if this were a shop, the checkout page should serve as a way to display the dogs you want to adopt.

    1. It should display the "dogs to adopt" in a list manner.
    2. Each list item must contain a `Remove from Basket` button.
    3. The checkout navigation item should have a small badge displaying the number of items (dogs) that are in your basket.
    4. A button on the bottom for submitting your adoption!

## JS

Let's start adding functionality to our app!

Our first functional requirement is pretty obvious: we need to change the page rendered ðŸ“º.

1. By default Dogs page should be displayed.
2. When "Adoptions" link is clicked, Adoptions section should be displayed.
3. The same for "Checkout" link, when clicked display Checkout section.

`ðŸ’¡ Note: Updating the url is not required, but nice to have.`

## Asynchrounous JavaScript

Now our app should interact with the API service.

**Spec**

1. Dogs:

  - Use the service provided to get and display the list of dogs.
  - "Adopt" button should add the dog to the basket (checkout) and remove it from the list of Dogs.

`ðŸ’¡ Note: Earn bonus points by adding a "Loading" message!`

2. Adoptions:

  - Use the service provided to retrieve and display all adoptions.

3. Checkout:

  - "Remove from Basket" button remove the dog from checkout and put it back into the list of Dogs.
  - "Submit" button should interact with backend and add the dogs to adoptions.

The backend API is pretty simple: When running the server you can check the details here: [http://localhost:3333/docs/](http://localhost:3333/docs/).

**ðŸ’¡ Note:** If you need to clean out the adoptions in your client, just restart the server!

## Unit Testing

Shouldn't all code be tested it? ðŸ”¨

Show us how you test your code. Here functionality examples you can test:

1. Components
2. Buttons callbacks.
3. Asynchronous methods with a stub for the api service.

Easy Peasy huh? Good luck and feel free to ask any questions! ðŸ‘¾
